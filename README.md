# x_y_z_heatmap

### Inputs

2. Plot Figure size
3. Colorscheme 
4. Console: Data callout, plot bounds, background image options

   
## heatmaps_plotter
Sole aim of this script is to plot heatmap. Script asks for x and y plot bounds, allowing you to determine how large yu want your heatmap to look in the plot area. 

## heatmaps_basic_image_overlay
This builds on the heatmaps plotter by providing the option to provide a background image. Note: while the x dimension of images is left to right, the y dimension is up to down, NOT down to up. 

## heatmaps-advanced_overlay
Experimental and not fully tested. Should allow you to match up image coordinates to plot points, from which the image will be scaled.
